**Introduction to Data Analytics, SQL Graded task**

**Tasks**
**1. An overview of Products**


**1.1** Youâ€™ve been asked to extract the data on products from the Product table where there exists a product subcategory. And also include the name of the ProductSubcategory.

**Columns needed:**

ProductId, Name, ProductNumber, size, color, ProductSubcategoryId, Subcategory name. Order results by SubCategory name.

-----
**1.2** In 1.1 query you have a product subcategory but see that you could use the category name.

Find and add the product category name. Afterwards order the results by Category name.

-----
**1.3** Use the established query to select the most expensive (price listed over 2000) bikes that are still actively sold (does not have a sales end date). 
Order the results from most to least expensive bike.

-----
**2. Reviewing work orders**


**2.1** Create an aggregated query to selec tthe:

Number of unique work orders.
Number of unique products.
Total actual cost.
For each location Id from the 'workoderrouting' table for orders in January 2004.

-----
**2.2** Update your 2.1 query by adding the name of the location and also add the average days amount between actual start date and actual end date per each location.

-----
**2.3** Select all the expensive work Orders (above 300 actual cost) that happened throught January 2004.

-----
**3. Query validation** Below you will find 2 queries that need to be fixed/updated.

Doubleclick on the cell of the query and you will see it in the original format, copy it into your Bigquery interface and try to fix it there.
Once you have it fixed, copy into your spreadsheet of results among previous task results.

-----
**3.1** Your colleague has written a query to find the highest sales connected to special offers. The query works fine but the numbers are off, investigate where the potential issue lies.

**CODE:**

**SELECT**
sales_detail.SalesOrderId, sales_detail.OrderQty, sales_detail.UnitPrice, sales_detail.LineTotal, sales_detail.ProductId, sales_detail.SpecialOfferID, spec_offer_product.rowguid, spec_offer_product.ModifiedDate, 
spec_offer.Category, spec_offer.Description

**FROM** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.salesorderdetail as sales_detail

**LEFT JOIN** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialofferproduct as spec_offer_product on sales_detail.productId = spec_offer_product.ProductID

**LEFT JOIN** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialoffer as spec_offer on sales_detail.SpecialOfferID = spec_offer.SpecialOfferID

**ORDER BY** LineTotal **DESC**

-----

**3.2** Your colleague has written this query to collect basic Vendor information. 

The query does not work, look into the query and find ways to fix it. 

Can you provide any feedback on how to make this query be easier to debug/read?

**QUERY BELOW:**

**SELECT** a.VendorId as Id,vendor_contact.ContactId, b.ContactTypeId, a.Name, a.CreditRating, a.ActiveFlag, c.AddressId,d.City

**FROM** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.Vendor as a

**LEFT JOIN** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.vendorcontact as vendor_contact on vendor.VendorId = vendor_contact.VendorId left join tc-da1.adwentureworks_db.vendoraddress as c on a.VendorId = c.VendorId

**LEFT JOIN** tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.address as address on vendor_address.VendorId = d.VendorId
